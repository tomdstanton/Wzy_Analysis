# Redefining bacterial Wzy polymerase families via three-dimensional structure-based clustering

## Introduction
This code accompanies the manuscript on redefining bacterial Wzy polymerase families via three-dimensional 
structure-based clustering.

## Installation
All relevant files can be downloaded directly from this repository like so:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tomdstanton/Wzy_Analysis.git && cd Wzy_Analysis
```

Then `pip` or `uv` can be used to install any packages needed to replicate the analysis:
```shell
pip install .
```

## Running the code
All code for analysis is contained within the Jupyter 
[notebooks](https://github.com/tomdstanton/Wzy_Analysis/tree/main/notebooks).

They can be run with Jupyter or with 
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tomdstanton/Wzy_Analysis/blob/master/).
